## Election-Audit Summary

The analysis of the election was simplified and efficiently concluded by using a python script. With a few lines of code, the script was able to loop around each line of data, and extract the releveant information regarding the candidates, votes, how voters voted, where votes voted and etcetera. This script can be used in other elections to efficiently and accurately report relevant data with a few changes to the script. As an example, this script can be used to return results from anything like local mayorial elections or any other data you get. You would simply point it to the data source, and change a few ilines depending on what you need, so i would highly recommend getting familiar with the script and using a modified versionof it in the future
